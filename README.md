# Face Verification

This project is a simple machine learning application to verify faces. It was creating using Jupyter notebooks and keras. All of the results can be see in the [notebook](https://github.com/Bren077s/FaceVerification/blob/master/FaceVerification.ipynb).

In order to run all of the code, you would need to remerge the weight files. They were split using [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) and can be remerged using the same program.
